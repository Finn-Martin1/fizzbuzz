# Fizz Buzz Game in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Fizz Buzz game in Python. Fizz Buzz is a common programming exercise where you write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Getting Started

To run the Fizz Buzz game on your local machine, make sure you have Python installed. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```bash
# Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fizz-buzz-python.git
