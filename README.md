# Fizz Buzz Game in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Fizz Buzz game in Python. Fizz Buzz is a common programming exercise where you write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
